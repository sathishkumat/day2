Write a gifferent between document and window objects
    1, The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object
 that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
    
    2, A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document. 
    
    3, The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in
 the window object.
    4, document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.
    5, window is the global object you can reference any properties of it with just the property 
name - so you do not have to write down window. - it will be figured out by the runtime.
    6, The document object is the root node of the HTML document. The document object is a property of the window object.
    7, Window object − Top of the hierarchy. It is the outmost element of the object hierarchy. 
    8, Document object − Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object.
    9, A document is a form of information that might be useful to a user or set of users. 
    10,  This information can be in digital and nondigital forms. Accordingly, a document can be either digital or nondigital. 
Different methods are used to store digital and nondigital documents.
